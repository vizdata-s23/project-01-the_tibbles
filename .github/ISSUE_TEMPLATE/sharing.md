Hello team,

Please let me know by responding below if you are

1. OK with your project website being linked to from the course page, primarily for prospective students in future semesters to get a sense of what they can learn in the course [only your names, writeup, and presentation slides will be visible publicly, not your source code, commits, issues]

2. interested in forking your project repo so you can feature it on your individual GitHub profiles [your names, writeup, and presentation slides, as well as your source code, commits, and issues, will be visible publicly, issues containing grades will be redacted]

Please reply with your response. Possible responses are as follows:

- No to both
- Yes to 1 and no to 2
- Yes to 2 and no to 1
- Yes to both

Your answers will in no way affect your grade in this class. Team consensus for both questions is mandatory. You can either have each person in the team reply individually or a representative from the team reply on the team's behalf, and tag other team members in their reply.

Thank you!
