# Using Quarto for presentations

## Quarto

-   The presentation is created using the Quarto CLI

-   `##` sets the start of a new slide

## Layouts

You can use plain text

-   or bullet points

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
or text in two columns $^*$
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
-   like
-   this

## Code

```{r}
#| label: boring-regression

# a boring regression
model <- lm(dist ~ speed, data = cars)
tidy(model)
glance(model)
```

## Plots

```{r}
#| label: recode-species
#| echo: false

# In this chunk I'm doing a bunch of analysis that I don't want to present 
# in my slides. But I need the resulting data frame for a plot I want to present.

penguins_modified <- penguins %>%
  mutate(species = fct_other(species, keep = "Adelie"))
```

```{r}
#| label: plot-penguins
#| echo: false
#| warning: false
#| fig-alt: |
#|   Body mass vs. flipper lenght of Palmer Penguins for species Adelie and all 
#|   the others combined together. There is a relatively strong, positive 
#|   relationship between the two variables. The Adelie penguins are clustered 
#|   together but they don't exhibit a different trend than the rest of the 
#|   penguins.

# Uses modified penguins dataset from previous chunk
# Play around with height and width until you're happy with the look

ggplot(
  penguins_modified, 
  aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g, color = species)
  ) +
  geom_point() + 
  theme_minimal()
```

## Plot and text

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   Some text
-   goes here
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
```{r}
#| warning: false
#| out-width: "100%"
#| fig-width: 4
#| echo: false

# See how I changed out-width and fig-width from defaults
# to make the figure bigger

ggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = species, color = species)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  theme_minimal()
```

## Tables

If you want to generate a table, make sure it is in the HTML format (instead of Markdown or other formats), e.g.,

```{r}
#| label: penguins-table

gt(head(penguins))
```

## Images

## Math Expressions {.smaller}

You can write LaTeX math expressions inside a pair of dollar signs, e.g. \$\alpha+\beta\$ renders $\alpha+\beta$. You can use the display style with double dollar signs:

    $$\bar{X}=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^nX_i$$

$$\bar{X}=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^nX_i$$

Limitations:

1.  The source code of a LaTeX math expression must be in one line, unless it is inside a pair of double dollar signs, in which case the starting `$$` must appear in the very beginning of a line, followed immediately by a non-space character, and the ending `$$` must be at the end of a line, led by a non-space character;

2.  There should not be spaces after the opening `$` or before the closing `$`.

# Wrap up

## Feeling adventurous?

-   You are welcomed to use the default styling of the slides. In fact, that's what I expect majority of you will do. You will differentiate yourself with the content of your presentation.

-   But some of you might want to play around with slide styling. Some solutions for this can be found at https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/revealjs.
